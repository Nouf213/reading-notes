# Mark down is a language used in text editors that aloows you to format words,add images, and create lists. 

It is just a few of the features that can be used with MD.

for now we are using it in GitHub.

Ex on MD language:

" * " italic " * " 

(>) blockqoutes

' Inline code '

" ![ hyper image ] (img.png) "

" [Hyper link] (https://google.com) "

To write headers we use # ,for every header number we use the same number of hashtags. Example: h1 #header , h4 ####header

 

The ordered and unordered lists :

The ordered you can use sort of numbers or repeat the same number it will give you the same result. 

Unordered list only can be done with the * .

For making a table we use --- between rows, and | between columns.

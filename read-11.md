# Images

Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.

* Adding Images

> < img src="img_kid.jpg" alt="kid in a jacket">

* Height & Width of Images

< img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" width="600" height="450" />

* Place Images in Your Code:

1. before a paragraph The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.
inside the start of a paragraph The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.
in the middle of a paragraph The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.
Old Code: Aligning Images Horizontally

align horizontally.html HTML The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image.

## The align attribute can take these horizontal values:

1. left This aligns the image to the left

2. right This aligns the image to the right

3. Old Code: Aligning Images Vertically

4. top This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the top of the image.

5. middle This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the middle of the image.

6. bottom This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the bottom of the image.

## Three Rules for Creating Images

1. Save images in the right format
2. Save images at the right size
3. Use the correct resolution
4. There are several tools you can use to edit and save images to ensure that they are the right size, format, and resolution. The most popular tool amongst web professionals is Adobe Photoshop

## Image Formats:

 JPEG Whenever you have many different colors in a picture you should use a JPEG.

Image Formats: GIF Use GIF or PNG format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color.

## Image Dimensions

The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.

## REDUCING IMAGE SIZE

You can reduce the size of images to create a smaller version of the image.

## INCREASING IMAGE SIZE

You can’t increase the size of photos significantly without affecting the image quality.

## CHANGING SHAPE 

Only some images can be cropped without losing valuable information.

Cropping Images When cropping images it is important not to lose valuable information. It is best to source images that are the correct shape if possible.

Image Resolution Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.

Vector Images are created by placing points on a grid, and drawing lines between those points. A color can then be added to “fill in” the lines that have been created.

The advantage of creating line drawings in vector format is that you can increase the dimensions of the image without affecting the quality of it.

Transparency Creating an image that is partially transparent (or “see-through”) for the web involves selecting one of two formats:

## Transparent GIF

PNG
Checking the Size of Images right click on the image of website and open it in a new tab it will show under the image the size of image.

Figure and Figure Caption < figure> Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new < figure> element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated.

You can have more than one image inside the < figure> element as long as they all share the same caption.

The < figcaption> element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.

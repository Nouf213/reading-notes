----------------------------------

# The Evolution of HTML
* ## HTML 4
had some **presentational** elements to
control the appearance of pages,
authors are not recommended to
use them any more.
* ## XHTML 1.0 
Since HTML was the most widely used
markup language around, it was
decided that **HTML 4** should be
reformulated to follow the rules
of *XML* and it was renamed
***XHTML***. This meant that
authors had to follow some new,
more strict rules about writing
markup. For example:
* Every element needed a
closing tag (except for empty
elements such as <img />).
* Attribute names had to be in
lowercase.
* All attributes required a value,
and all values were to be
placed in double quotes.
* Deprecated elements should
no longer be used.
* Every element that was
opened inside another
element should be closed
inside that same element.

* ## HTML5
Web page authors do
not need to close all tags, and
new elements and attributes will
be introduced. At the time of
writing, the HTML5 specification
had not been completed.

------

# DOCTYPEs
Each web page should begin with a
**DOCTYPE** declaration to tell a
browser which version of *HTML*
the page is using.
![doctypes](images/doctype.png)

# Comments in HTML
 < !-- --> 
 If you want to add a **comment**
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters.

# ID Attribute 
Every **HTML** element can carry
the ***id attribute***. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page.
# Class Attribute
Every **HTML** element can
also carry a ***class attribute***.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page. 
# Block Elements
Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as ***block level*** elements. 
# Inline Elements
Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
***inline*** elements.
# Grouping Text &Elements In a Block
The < div> element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.
# Grouping Text &Elements Inline 
The < span> element acts like
an inline equivalent of the < div>
element. It is used to either:
1. Contain a section of text
where there is no other suitable
element to differentiate it from
its surrounding text.
2. Contain a number of inline
elements.
# IFrames
An **iframe** is like a little window
that has been cut into your
page â€” and in that window you
can see another page. The term
**iframe** is an abbreviation of ***inline frame***

# Information About Your Pages
< meta>
The < meta> element lives
inside the < head> element and
contains information about that
web page.
It is not visible to users but
fulfills a number of purposes
such as telling search engines
about your page.
